Using the API

Getting started

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

## [​](\#accessing-the-api)  Accessing the API

The API is made available via our web [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/). You can use the [Workbench](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench/3b57d80a-99f2-4760-8316-d3bb14fbfb1e) to try out the API in the browser and then generate API keys in [Account Settings](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys). Use [workspaces](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/workspaces) to segment your API keys and [control spend](/en/api/rate-limits) by use case.

## [​](\#authentication)  Authentication

All requests to the Anthropic API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.

## [​](\#content-types)  Content types

The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.
