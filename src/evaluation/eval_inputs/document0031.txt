Prompt engineering

Giving Claude a role with a system prompt

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

When using Claude, you can dramatically improve its performance by using the `system` parameter to give it a role. This technique, known as role prompting, is the most powerful way to use system prompts with Claude.

The right role can turn Claude from a general assistant into your virtual domain expert!

**System prompt tips**: Use the `system` parameter to set Claude’s role. Put everything else, like task-specific instructions, in the `user` turn instead.

## [​](\#why-use-role-prompting)  Why use role prompting?

- **Enhanced accuracy:** In complex scenarios like legal analysis or financial modeling, role prompting can significantly boost Claude’s performance.
- **Tailored tone:** Whether you need a CFO’s brevity or a copywriter’s flair, role prompting adjusts Claude’s communication style.
- **Improved focus:** By setting the role context, Claude stays more within the bounds of your task’s specific requirements.

## [​](\#how-to-give-claude-a-role)  How to give Claude a role

Use the `system` parameter in the [Messages API](/en/api/messages) to set Claude’s role:

Copy

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.", # <-- role prompt
    messages=[\
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies: <dataset>{{DATASET}}</dataset>"}\
    ]
)

print(response.content)

```

**Role prompting tip**: Experiment with roles! A `data scientist` might see different insights than a `marketing strategist` for the same data. A `data scientist specializing in customer insight analysis for Fortune 500 companies` might yield different results still!

## [​](\#examples)  Examples

### [​](\#example-1-legal-contract-analysis)  Example 1: Legal contract analysis

Without a role, Claude might miss critical issues:

Legal contract analysis without role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks:<br><contract><br>{{CONTRACT}}<br></contract><br>Focus on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. |
| Assistant | Here’s a summary of the key points in the software licensing agreement:<br>1\. Indemnification (Section 8):<br> \- We indemnify the vendor against claims arising from our use.<br>2\. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br> \- Damages capped at $500.<br>3\. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br> \- We retain ownership of our modifications.<br>Overall, the agreement seems standard. The indemnification and liability clauses are typical, and we maintain our IP rights. |

With a role, Claude catches critical issues that could cost millions:

Legal contract analysis with role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You are the General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company. We’re considering this software licensing agreement for our core data infrastructure:<br><contract><br>{{CONTRACT}}<br></contract><br>Analyze it for potential risks, focusing on indemnification, liability, and IP ownership. Give your professional opinion. |
| Assistant | I’ve reviewed the software licensing agreement, and I have serious concerns that could expose our company to significant risks:<br>1\. Indemnification (Section 8):<br> \- Critical Issue: We indemnify the vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.<br> \- Risk: This could hold us liable even for the vendor’s negligence or product defects.<br> \- Recommendation: Reject. Limit our indemnity to claims arising from our violation of the agreement.<br>2\. Limitation of Liability (Section 9):<br> \- Critical Issue: Damages capped at $500, including direct damages.<br> \- Risk: Grossly inadequate. A critical failure in our data infrastructure could cost us millions in lost revenue and reputational damage.<br> \- Recommendation: Reject. Negotiate for cap at 12 months of fees for direct damages, and carve-outs for data breaches.<br>3\. IP Ownership (Section 12):<br> \- Critical Issue: Vendor gains joint ownership of our modifications and integrations.<br> \- Risk: They could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights to competitors.<br> \- Recommendation: Reject. We must retain full ownership of our work.<br>Professional Opinion: Do not sign this agreement. It is grossly unfavorable and exposes us to unacceptable levels of risk. If the vendor refuses to renegotiate these terms, I strongly advise exploring alternative providers or accelerating our in-house solution. The potential costs of proceeding with this agreement far outweigh any short-term gains. |

### [​](\#example-2-financial-analysis)  Example 2: Financial analysis

Without a role, Claude’s analysis lacks depth:

Financial analysis without role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | Analyze this dataset of our Q2 financials:<br><data><br>{{FINANCIALS}}<br></data><br>Highlight key trends and recommend actions. |
| Assistant | Here’s a summary of your Q2 financials:<br>1\. Revenue: $15.2M, up 22% YoY. Enterprise client base grew 30%.<br>2\. Gross Margin: 72%, up 3% from Q1.<br>3\. EBITDA Margin: 18%, down 2% due to R&D investments.<br>4\. Cash Flow: $4.1M operating, $28M in reserves.<br>Overall, financials look strong with revenue growth and healthy margins. Increased R&D spending is impacting profitability but could pay off long-term. Maintain current course. |

With a role, Claude delivers actionable insights:

Financial analysis with role prompting

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You are the CFO of a high-growth B2B SaaS company. We’re in a board meeting discussing our Q2 financials:<br><data><br>{{FINANCIALS}}<br></data><br>Analyze key trends, flag concerns, and recommend strategic actions. Our investors want aggressive growth but are wary of our burn rate. |
| Assistant | Board members, here’s my analysis of our Q2 financials:<br>1\. Revenue ($15.2M, +22% YoY):<br> \- Insight: Enterprise growth (+30%) is outpacing overall growth.<br> \- Flag: SMB segment declined 5%.<br> \- Action: Reallocate 20% of SMB marketing budget to enterprise sales. Task product to simplify SMB onboarding.<br>2\. Margins (Gross: 72%, +3% QoQ; EBITDA: 18%, -2% QoQ):<br> \- Insight: Infrastructure optimizations boosted gross margins.<br> \- Flag: R&D spend on AI features dented EBITDA.<br> \- Action: No change. Our AI roadmap is critical for enterprise stickiness.<br>3\. Cash ($4.1M OCF, $28M reserves):<br> \- Insight: 15-month runway at current burn.<br> \- Flag: CAC up 20%, eroding LTV/CAC.<br> \- Action: Freeze non-essential hires. Implement sales funnel analytics to cut CAC by 15% in Q3.<br>Strategic Stance: We’re threading the needle between growth and burn. Enterprise focus is our growth engine—invest there. But watch SMB churn; it could bleed into enterprise. Our AI bet is sound, but we must convert it to ARR by Q4, or we cut R&D by 30%.<br>In sum: Double down on enterprise, streamline SMB, optimize sales, and monetize AI. Questions? |
