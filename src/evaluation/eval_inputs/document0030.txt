Prompt engineering

Be clear, direct, and detailed

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working.
The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude’s response will be.

**The golden rule of clear prompting**

Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they’re confused, Claude will likely be too.

## [​](\#how-to-be-clear-contextual-and-specific)  How to be clear, contextual, and specific

- **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:

  - What the task results will be used for
  - What audience the output is meant for
  - What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
  - The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
- **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
- **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

### [​](\#examples)  Examples

Example: Anonymizing customer feedback

Notice that Claude still makes mistakes in the unclear prompting example, such as leaving in a customer’s name.

| Role | Unclear Prompt | Clear Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | Please remove all personally identifiable information from these customer feedback messages: {{FEEDBACK\_DATA}} | Your task is to anonymize customer feedback for our quarterly review.<br>Instructions:<br>1\. Replace all customer names with “CUSTOMER\_\[ID\]” (e.g., “Jane Doe” → “CUSTOMER\_001”).<br>2\. Replace email addresses with “EMAIL\_\[ID\]@example.com”.<br>3\. Redact phone numbers as “PHONE\_\[ID\]“.<br>4\. If a message mentions a specific product (e.g., “AcmeCloud”), leave it intact.<br>5\. If no PII is found, copy the message verbatim.<br>6\. Output only the processed messages, separated by ”---“.<br>Data to process: {{FEEDBACK\_DATA}} |
| Assistant (Claude’s response) | Here are the anonymized customer feedback messages:<br>1\. I’ve been using your software for years, and it’s been great. But lately, AcmeCloud has been crashing a lot. Fix it!<br>2\. XXX, your customer support rep, was incredibly helpful. He guided me through the whole process. My email is XXX if you want to send a survey.<br>3\. I’m John Smith, and I’m not happy. I’ve been on hold for 2 hours trying to reach someone at XXX. This is unacceptable! | CUSTOMER\_001: I’ve been using your software for years, and it’s been great. But lately, AcmeCloud has been crashing a lot. Fix it!<br>\-\-\-<br>CUSTOMER\_002: CUSTOMER\_SERVICE\_001, your customer support rep, was incredibly helpful. He guided me through the whole process. My email is [EMAIL\_002@example.com](mailto:EMAIL_002@example.com) if you want to send a survey.<br>\-\-\-<br>CUSTOMER\_003: I’m CUSTOMER\_003, and I’m not happy. I’ve been on hold for 2 hours trying to reach someone at PHONE\_001. This is unacceptable! |

Example: Crafting a marketing email campaign

Notice that Claude makes up details to fill in the gaps where it lacks context with the vague prompt.

| Role | Vague Prompt | Specific Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |

Example: Incident response

Notice that Claude outputs superfluous text and different formating with the vague prompt.

| Role | Vague Prompt | Detailed Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | Analyze this AcmeCloud outage report and summarize the key points.<br>{{REPORT}} | Analyze this AcmeCloud outage report. Skip the preamble. Keep your response terse and write only the bare bones necessary information. List only:<br>1) Cause<br>2) Duration<br>3) Impacted services<br>4) Number of affected users<br>5) Estimated revenue loss. <br>Here’s the report: {{REPORT}} |
| Assistant (Claude’s response) | Here’s a summary of the key points from the AcmeCloud outage report:<br>On May 15th, a misconfigured load balancer update caused significant traffic routing issues, resulting in a service outage from 09:15 to 13:52 UTC. The 4-hour 37-minute disruption impacted our core file syncing service and admin dashboard, rendering them inaccessible. Additionally, the mobile app experienced partial functionality loss. Approximately 68% of our user base, totaling 1.3 million users, were affected. Based on our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and average revenue per user, we estimate a financial impact of $420,000 in service credits and potential customer churn. | 1) Cause: Misconfigured load balancer update<br>2) Duration: 4h 37m (09:15-13:52 UTC, May 15)<br>3) Impacted: Core sync, admin dashboard (down); mobile app (partial)<br>4) Affected users: 1.3M (68% of base)<br>5) Est. revenue loss: $420,000 |
