Strengthen guardrails

Increase output consistency (JSON mode)

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

Here’s how to make Claude’s responses more consistent:

## [​](\#specify-the-desired-output-format)  Specify the desired output format

Precisely define your desired output format using JSON, XML, or custom templates so that Claude understands every output formatting element you require.

Example: Standardizing customer feedback

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You’re a Customer Insights AI. Analyze this feedback and output in JSON format with keys: “sentiment” (positive/negative/neutral), “key\_issues” (list), and “action\_items” (list of dicts with “team” and “task”).<br>“I’ve been a loyal user for 3 years, but the recent UI update is a disaster. Finding basic features is now a scavenger hunt. Plus, the new ‘premium’ pricing is outrageous. I’m considering switching unless this is fixed ASAP.” |
| Assistant | {<br> “sentiment”: “negative”,<br> “key\_issues”: \[<br> “Poor UI/UX in recent update”,<br> “Difficulty finding basic features”,<br> “Perceived high pricing (new ‘premium’ tier)”<br> \],<br> “action\_items”: \[<br> {<br> “team”: “Product”,<br> “task”: “Conduct usability testing and iterate on UI based on findings”<br> },<br> {<br> “team”: “UX”,<br> “task”: “Create a feature discovery guide or onboarding flow”<br> },<br> {<br> “team”: “Marketing”,<br> “task”: “Review pricing strategy and communicate value proposition”<br> },<br> {<br> “team”: “Customer Success”,<br> “task”: “Reach out to user, offer concessions to prevent churn”<br> }<br> \]<br>} |

## [​](\#prefill-claudes-response)  Prefill Claude’s response

Prefill the `Assistant` turn with your desired format. This trick bypasses Claude’s friendly preamble and enforces your structure.

Example: Daily sales report

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You’re an insightful Sales Intelligence AI. Generate today’s sales report.<br>Structure the report like this:<br><report><br> <summary><br> <metric name=“total\_revenue”>0.00\\</metric><br/> \\<metric name="units\_sold">0\\</metric><br/> \\<metric name="avg\_order\_value">\0.00</metric><br> </summary><br> <top\_products><br> <product><br> <name>Product Name</name><br> <revenue>$0.00</revenue><br> <units>0</units><br> </product><br> …<br> </top\_products><br> <regional\_performance><br> <region><br> <name>Region Name</name><br> <revenue>$0.00</revenue><br> <growth>0.0%</growth><br> </region><br> …<br> </regional\_performance><br> <action\_items><br> <item>Action item.</item><br> …<br> </action\_items><br></report> |
| Assistant (prefill) | <report><br> <summary><br> <metric name= |
| Assistant | “total\_revenue”>$842,567.00</metric><br> <metric name=“units\_sold”>15,238</metric><br> <metric name=“avg\_order\_value”>$55.29</metric><br> </summary><br> <top\_products><br> <product><br> <name>AcmeGuard Pro</name><br> <revenue>$325,890.00</revenue><br> <units>3,621</units><br> </product><br> <product><br> <name>AcmeVault Enterprise</name><br> <revenue>$254,400.00</revenue><br> <units>1,272</units><br> </product><br> <product><br> <name>AcmeBoost XL</name><br> <revenue>147,690.00\\</revenue><br/> \\<units>4,923\\</units><br/> \\</product><br/> \\</top\_products><br/> \\<regional\_performance><br/> \\<region><br/> \\<name>APAC\\</name><br/> \\<revenue>\258,960.00</revenue><br> <growth>12.8%</growth><br> </region><br> <region><br> <name>EMEA</name><br> <revenue>$325,478.00</revenue><br> <growth>3.2%</growth><br> </region><br> <region><br> <name>Americas</name><br> <revenue>$258,129.00</revenue><br> <growth>-2.1%</growth><br> </region><br> </regional\_performance><br> <action\_items><br> <item>Investigate Americas revenue drop; schedule regional sales team meeting.</item><br> <item>Accelerate CloudGuard Pro rollout in APAC to capitalize on growth.</item><br> <item>Review NetBoost XL pricing; high volume but lower revenue.</item><br> </action\_items><br></report> |

## [​](\#constrain-with-examples)  Constrain with examples

Provide examples of your desired output. This trains Claude’s understanding better than abstract instructions.

Example: Generating consistent market intelligence

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | As a Market Intelligence AI, your task is to analyze data about our competitors. Here is our competitor data:<br><data><br>{{DATA}}<br></data><br>Output following this example format:<br><competitor><br> <name>Rival Inc</name><br> <overview>A 50-word summary.</overview><br> <swot><br> <strengths>- Bullet points</strengths><br> <weaknesses>- Bullet points</weaknesses><br> <opportunities>- Bullet points</opportunities><br> <threats>- Bullet points</threats><br> </swot><br> <strategy>A 30-word strategic response.</strategy><br></competitor><br>Now, analyze AcmeGiant and AcmeDataCo using this format. |
| Assistant | <competitor><br> <name>AcmeGiant</name><br> <overview>Global tech leader with a vast ecosystem of consumer and enterprise products.

Target accounts struggling with DataCo’s scale limitations.</strategy><br></competitor> |

## [​](\#use-retrieval-for-contextual-consistency)  Use retrieval for contextual consistency

For tasks requiring consistent context (e.g., chatbots, knowledge bases), use retrieval to ground Claude’s responses in a fixed information set.

Example: Enhancing IT support consistency

| Role | Content |
| --- | --- |
| User | You’re our IT Support AI that draws on knowledge base data. Here are entries from your knowledge base:<br><kb><br> <entry><br> <id>1</id><br> <title>Reset Active Directory password</title><br> <content>1. Go to password.ourcompany.com<br>2\. Enter your username<br>3\. Click “Forgot Password”<br>4\. Follow email instructions</content><br> </entry><br> <entry><br> <id>2</id><br> <title>Connect to VPN</title><br> <content>1. Install GlobalProtect from software center<br>2\. Open GlobalProtect, enter “vpn.ourcompany.com”<br>3\. Use AD credentials to log in</content><br> </entry><br></kb><br>When helping users, always check the knowledge base first. Respond in this format:<br><response><br> <kb\_entry>Knowledge base entry used</kb\_entry><br> <answer>Your response</answer><br></response> Write some test questions for yourself and answer them using the knowledge base, just to make sure you understand how to use the knowledge base properly. |
| Assistant | Understood. I’ll use the knowledge base for consistent responses. Let’s test with a couple of scenarios.<br>User: Hey, I can’t log into my email. I think I forgot my password.<br><response><br> <kb\_entry>1: Reset Active Directory password</entry><br> <answer>I understand you’re having trouble logging into your email due to a forgotten password. No worries, this is a common issue. To reset your Active Directory password, which is used for email access, follow these steps:<br>1\. Go to password.ourcompany.com<br>2\. Enter your username (same as your email address)<br>3\. Click on the “Forgot Password” link<br>4\. You’ll receive an email with instructions. Follow them to reset your password.<br>After resetting, you should be able to log into your email. Let me know if you need any further assistance.</answer><br></response><br>User: I’m working from home today. How do I access internal resources?<br><response><br> <kb\_entry>2: Connect to VPN</entry><br> <answer>Great question! To access internal resources while working from home, you’ll need to connect to our company VPN (Virtual Private Network). Here’s how to set that up:<br>1\. First, install the GlobalProtect VPN client. You can find this in our software center.<br>2\. Once installed, open the GlobalProtect application.<br>3\. In the server field, enter “vpn.ourcompany.com”.<br>4\. Use your Active Directory (AD) credentials to log in - the same username and password you use for your email.<br>Once connected, you’ll have secure access to all internal resources as if you were in the office. Let me know if you run into any issues during setup.</answer><br></response> |

## [​](\#chain-prompts-for-complex-tasks)  Chain prompts for complex tasks

Break down complex tasks into smaller, consistent subtasks. Each subtask gets Claude’s full attention, reducing inconsistency errors across scaled workflows.
