Prompt engineering

Use XML tags to structure your prompts

[Welcome](/en/home) [User Guides](/en/docs/welcome) [API Reference](/en/api/getting-started) [Prompt Library](/en/prompt-library/library) [Release Notes](/en/release-notes/overview) [Developer Newsletter](/en/developer-newsletter/overview)

When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

**XML tip**: Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<example>`, and `<formatting>` to clearly separate different parts of your prompt. This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions with examples or context.

## [​](\#why-use-xml-tags)  Why use XML tags?

- **Clarity:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is well structured.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt.
- **Flexibility:** Easily find, add, remove, or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting everything.
- **Parseability:** Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract specific parts of its response by post-processing.

There are no canonical “best” XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular, although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information they surround.

## [​](\#tagging-best-practices)  Tagging best practices

1. **Be consistent**: Use the same tag names throughout your prompts, and refer to those tag names when talking about the content (e.g, `Using the contract in <contract> tags...`).
2. **Nest tags**: You should nest tags `<outer><inner></inner></outer>` for hierarchical content.

**Power user tip**: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting ( `<examples>`) or chain of thought ( `<thinking>`, `<answer>`). This creates super-structured, high-performance prompts.

### [​](\#examples)  Examples

Example: Generating financial reports

Without XML tags, Claude misunderstands the task and generates a report that doesn’t match the required structure or tone. After substitution, there is also a chance that Claude misunderstands where one section (like the the Q1 report example) stops and another begins.

| User | You’re a financial analyst at AcmeCorp. Generate a Q2 financial report for our investors. Include sections on Revenue Growth, Profit Margins, and Cash Flow, like with this example from last year: {{Q1\_REPORT}}. Use data points from this spreadsheet: {{SPREADSHEET\_DATA}}. The report should be extremely concise, to the point, professional, and in list format. It should and highlight both strengths and areas for improvement. | You’re a financial analyst at AcmeCorp.

| Assistant | Q2 Financial Report for AcmeCorp Investors<br>Dear Valued Investors,<br>I am pleased to present our Q2 financial report, showcasing AcmeCorp’s continued growth and resilience in the B2B SaaS market.<br>1\. Revenue Growth:<br>Our Q2 revenue reached $15.2M, a 22% YoY increase. This growth is primarily driven by a 30% expansion in our enterprise client base. However, our SMB segment saw a slight decline of 5%, which we aim to address through targeted marketing initiatives in Q3.<br>2\. Profit Margins:<br>Gross margin improved to 72% (up 3% from Q1) due to infrastructure optimizations. EBITDA margin, however, dipped to 18% (down 2%) as we invested heavily in R&D for our upcoming AI-driven features.<br>3\. Cash Flow:<br>Operating cash flow remains strong at $4.1M. Our cash reserves stand at $28M, providing a 15-month runway at current burn rate. We did see a 20% increase in customer acquisition costs, which we’re addressing through more efficient sales strategies.<br>In summary, AcmeCorp’s core financials remain robust.

Example: Legal contract analysis

Without XML tags, Claude’s analysis is disorganized and misses key points. With tags, it provides a structured, thorough analysis that a legal team can act on.

| Role | No XML Tags | With XML Tags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | Analyze this software licensing agreement for potential risks and liabilities: {{CONTRACT}}. Focus on indemnification, limitation of liability, and IP ownership clauses. Also, note any unusual or concerning terms. Here’s our standard contract for reference: {{STANDARD\_CONTRACT}}. Give a summary of findings and recommendations for our legal team. | Analyze this software licensing agreement for legal risks and liabilities.<br>We’re a multinational enterprise considering this agreement for our core data infrastructure.<br><agreement><br>{{CONTRACT}}</agreement><br>This is our standard contract for reference:<br><standard\_contract>{{STANDARD\_CONTRACT}}</standard\_contract><br><instructions><br>1\. Analyze these clauses:<br> \- Indemnification<br> \- Limitation of liability<br> \- IP ownership<br>2\. Note unusual or concerning terms.<br>3\. Compare to our standard contract.<br>4\. Summarize findings in <findings> tags.<br>5\. List actionable recommendations in <recommendations> tags.</instructions> |
| Assistant | The provided software licensing agreement presents several concerning aspects. The indemnification clause is overly broad, potentially exposing us to significant liabilities. The limitation of liability section caps damages at a mere $500, which is inadequate for our enterprise-level usage. Regarding IP, the agreement grants the vendor joint ownership of any modifications or integrations we create.<br>In summary, this agreement is not in our best interest. It exposes us to undue risk, limits our recourse in case of failures, and compromises our intellectual property rights. I recommend renegotiating these terms or seeking alternative vendors. | <findings><br>1\. Indemnification (Clause 8):<br> \- Issue: Overly broad. We indemnify vendor against “any and all claims” arising from our use.<br> \- Risk: Could hold us liable even for vendor’s negligence or product defects.<br> \- Deviation: Our standard limits indemnity to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br>2\. Limitation of Liability (Clause 9):<br> \- Issue: Caps all damages at $500, including direct damages.<br> \- Risk: Grossly inadequate for enterprise use. A critical failure could cost millions.<br> \- Deviation: Our standard allows for direct damages up to 12 months of fees paid.<br>3\. IP Ownership (Clause 12):<br> \- Issue: Grants vendor joint ownership of our modifications/integrations.<br> \- Risk: Vendor could use or sell our proprietary algorithms or data insights.<br> \- Deviation: Our standard retains full ownership of our work.<br>4\. Unusual Terms:<br> \- Clause 5.3: Vendor can use our usage data for “any purpose.”<br> \- Clause 7.2: Vendor can terminate for “convenience” with only 7 days’ notice.<br> \- Clause 11: No warranties of any kind, even for basic merchantability.<br></findings><br><recommendations><br>1\. Reject this agreement. Risks far outweigh benefits for an enterprise.<br>2\. Counter-propose:<br> \- Indemnification: Limit to claims arising from our violation of agreement.<br> \- Liability: Cap at 12 months’ fees for direct damages; negotiate for indirect.<br> \- IP: Full ownership of our modifications/integrations.<br> \- Data Use: Restrict to service improvement only.<br> \- Termination: Minimum 90 days’ notice; only for cause.<br> \- Warranties: Demand basic merchantability and fitness for purpose.<br>3\. If vendor refuses, explore alternative providers or in-house solutions.<br>4\. Engage legal counsel for contract negotiation given high stakes.<br></recommendations> |
