# Guideline Evaluator [¶](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/evaluation/guideline_eval/\#guideline-evaluator)

This notebook shows how to use `GuidelineEvaluator` to evaluate a question answer system given user specified guidelines.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

=====
Guideline: The response should fully answer the query.
Pass: False
Feedback: The response does not fully answer the query. While it does provide a brief overview of global warming, it does not delve into the specifics of the causes, effects, or potential solutions to the problem. The response should be more detailed and comprehensive to fully answer the query.
=====
Guideline: The response should avoid being vague or ambiguous.
Pass: False
Feedback: The response is too vague and does not provide specific details about global warming. It should include more information about the causes, effects, and potential solutions to global warming.
=====
Guideline: The response should be specific and use statistics or numbers when possible.
Pass: False
Feedback: The response is too general and lacks specific details or statistics about global warming. It would be more informative if it included data such as the rate at which the Earth's temperature is rising, the main human activities contributing to global warming, or the specific adverse effects on the planet.
